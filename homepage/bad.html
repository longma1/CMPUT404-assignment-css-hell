<h1>About me</h1>

<p> Hi there and welcome to my site. My name is Long and I am currently a 4th year
computer science student at the university of Alberta. </p>

<h1>Professional History</h1>
<p>
I currently have no profesional experience in software development but I am eager to learn.
I have worked the odd customer service jobs over summers to help fund my universtiy tuition, jobs
that I believe helped me mature as a person.

<h1>What I have to offer</h1>
<p>I would say that I'm pretty good at python, having worked on many projects with it ranging 
from web development using Django, reincforced learning using numpy to search algorithms based on
the popular game Gomoku. I also have quite a bit of experience doing mobile development, my proudest
project being the mobile application I wrote for HackED2019 which relayed information from mobile client
to a server.</p>
